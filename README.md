# AddressBook
Simple JavaFX application for storing contacts.

This was created as a JavaFX challenge for the Java Master Class online class on Udemy. I got partial code in the ContactData class
from the instructor. The rest of the code was written by me. The goal of this challenge was to create a functional app for keeping
an book of phone contacts.
